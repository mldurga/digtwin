    "# AVEVA Process Optimization and AVEVA PI System Integration: Template Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction: Overview of AVEVA Process Optimization (APO)\n",
    "\n",
    "AVEVA Process Optimization, often utilizing the ROMeo engine, is a powerful tool for rigorous online modeling and equation-based optimization within industrial processes. It's designed for both online (real-time) and offline use, emphasizing ease of use and high customizability. Unlike sequential-modular simulators, APO employs an equation-based solver, making it particularly effective for large, complex flowsheets with recycle streams. It's built on an object-oriented architecture, leveraging established technologies for stability and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key capabilities of APO include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simulation:** Predicting steady-state operation by solving phase equilibrium, material, and energy balance equations.\n",
    "* **Data Reconciliation:** Adjusting measurements and tuning parameters to satisfy balance equations, minimizing the mismatch between measured and calculated values.\n",
    "* **Optimization:** Identifying the most profitable operating conditions (e.g., setpoints) for a process.\n",
    "* **Parameterization & Customization:** Adding custom equations and user-defined models, providing flexibility to tailor the system to specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Equation-Based Solver:** ROMeo, provides superior solving capability of complex processes\n",
    "* **Online and Offline Use:** Suitable for both real-time and planning/design scenarios.\n",
    "* **Object-Oriented Architecture:** Modern design for maintainability and extensibility.\n",
    "* **Client-Server Model:** Robust and scalable architecture.\n",
    "* **Customization:** High degree of flexibility through user-defined equations and models.\n",
    "* **Case Management:** Save and reload different model scenarios.\n",
    "* **Real Time System:** Sequence and schedule tasks\n",
